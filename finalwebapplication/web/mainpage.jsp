            <h1>Mobile Virtual Manager</h1>
                <br />  <p>In this fairly competitive world, where everyone is running a rat race to be the best, the role of technology and productivity increases multifoldly in such a scenario. To be ahead of competitors and to have an extra edge a fairly efficient android application that manages wirelessly our computer with a feature of virtualization is nothing but an added advantage to it.</p>

            <h1>Why Virtualization?</h1>
            <br />  <p>The usual goal of virtualization is to centralize administrative tasks while improving scalability and overall hardware-resource utilization. With virtualization, several operating systems (OSs) can be run in parallel on a single CPU. This parallelism tends to reduce overhead costs and differs from multitasking, which involves running several programs on the same OS.</p>
